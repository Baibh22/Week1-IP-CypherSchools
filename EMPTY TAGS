    <H1>BR TAG </H1>
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    <BR>
    And sorry I could not travel both
    <BR>
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    <BR>
    And looked down one as far as I could
    <BR>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    <BR>

    <P>

        Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc.&nbsp;In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116)
